          <h5>12.05.2017</h5>
          <p>This week we read a paper on <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.7343&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Digital Natives by Eszter Hargittai</a>. One of my biggest reservations about this paper stems from the dependent variables it relies on. In particular, the author uses a self reported skill metric to determine how skillful people are at using the internet, and then, using this constructed index, concluded that it seems like young women are less skilled on average at using the internet than young men. I'm concerned that, given considerable social research suggesting that women tend to systematically underrate their abilities as compared to men, the effect Hargittai found might be entirely dominated by gendered willingnesses to brag about ones abilities.</p>

          <h5>12.07.2017</h5>
          <p>Today I decided on what I want to study over the course of the Digital Natives project. I am interested in the ways that individuals talk to each other online, and am curious whether I might be able to discover patterns in the way I talk to people on different media platforms. I will look at my Facebook and GMail data primarily, and think about how my text conversations vary on each platform.</p>

          <h5>12.11.2017</h5>
          <p>Today I downloaded all the Facebook messenger data I will use for the purposes of this project and created a notebook to convert the .html files they came in to a list of dictionaries containing all the messages I've ever sent over Facebook.</p>

          <h5>12.19.2017</h5>
          <p>Today I completed the first portion of my data analysis project. I created a notebook where I asked and answered three main questions: (a) What words do I use that differentiate myself the greatest from my friends online? (b) Which people do I talk to most online? (c) Do I talk to different people differently online (i.e. do I codeswitch)?</p>

          <p>One of the things that most surprised me about this process was many of my Facebook messages are directed at the same few people. In fact, 17% of the Facebook messages that I send and receive and between me and one other person! It makes me wonder whether I ought to branch out my social communication and connect more with a greater variety of people online.</p>

          <h5>12.20.2017</h5>
          <p>Today, I finished the GMail data analysis notebook. I answered two main questions: (a) How do I express myself differently via e-mail as opposed to via Facebook Messenger? (b) Do the emails I send contain more words on average than the messages I send on Facebook?</p>
